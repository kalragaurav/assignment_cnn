## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- After carefully analyzing the performance of all models on Test data, Model with dropouts, normalization and augmented data did fairly well with close to 75% accuracy on both test and validation data.
